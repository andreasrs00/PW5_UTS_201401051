                  Like mechanical and quartz, Kinetic is a platform. Over the
                  past 20 years, Seiko has created on this platform a suite of
                  Kinetic movements, each bringing unique features to the
                  consumer. It was at the 1986 Basel Fair that Seiko unveiled
                  its first Kinetic prototype. Introduced under the trial name
                  of ‘AGM’, it was the first watch in the world to convert
                  kinetic movement into electrical energy.Functioning akin to
                  mechanical and quartz counterparts, Kinetic serves as a
                  versatile platform for Seiko. The past two decades, Seiko has
                  meticulously developed a suite of Kinetic movements.

                  It’s a contrast in polished and matte stainless that will
                  immediately catch your attention, if a classic diver watch is
                  not sufficient to interest you. The watch has a good amount of
                  heft to it, so you don’t need to be afraid of losing it
                  carelessly. But you also got to stay careful of not hitting
                  someone with it, even jokingly; a sport that men rather enjoy
                  after downing a few beers.The day window shows Arabic letters
                  in our pictures but you can set this watch to display the day

                  SKX007’s immediate ancestor is the Seiko 7002, which it
                  closely resembles, and it shares with SKX007 a water
                  resistance rating of 200 m. It was produced until 1996, when
                  it was finally replaced by the model you see here. SKX007 is
                  also no longer in production but can be found on the secondary
                  market, which is unfortunate as it represents the entry price
                  point into the world of Seiko diver’s watches – as a matter of
                  fact, it probably represents the entry price point into the
                  world of genuine, ISO-compliant mechanical diver’s watches.As
                  enthusiasts seek the SKX007 on the secondary market.

                  grants this watch a soft presence and unparalleled depth. The

                  With its classic profile and high resistance to wear, the new
                  SBGW295 is an ideal expression of Grand Seiko’s mission to
                  craft practical watches for everyday wear. Moreover, one of
                  the two supplied straps incorporates a traditional Japanese
                  weaving technique called yoroiori that was once used for
                  making samurai armor. Thin strips of calf leather and fabric
                  are interlaced by a skilled artisan to enhance the watch

                  The movement was crafted by the Micro Artist Studio, the team
                  behind the Masterpiece Collection, and features the Spring
                  Drive Caliber 9R02, which has a maximum power reserve of
                  approximately 84 hours when fully wound. This is made possible
                  by the combination of the Dual Spring Barrel and Torque Return
                  System. When the mainspring has been fully wound and the
                  torque output is highest, approximately 30% of the power isn’t
                  needed to maintain the watch’s precision. The ingenious
                  integration of these mechanisms not only ensures an extended
                  power reserve but also underscores Grand Seiko's commitment to
                  pushing the boundaries of horological innovation. Exemplifying
